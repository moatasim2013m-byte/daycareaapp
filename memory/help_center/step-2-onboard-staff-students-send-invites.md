Now that your school details and access controls are set up, the next step is onboarding staff and students. This ensures everyone can access Illumine and operations can begin smoothly from Day 1.

## 1) Add Staff Members 👩‍🏫

For each staff member:
- Assign the correct **Role** (created in Step 1)
- Link them to a **Classroom**
- Enter contact details (**phone or email is required**)

> 📌 Tip: Ensure roles are pre-configured under `Settings → Access Control` before assigning roles in Staff.

## 2) Add Students 🧒

**Path:** `Management → Students`

For each student:
- Add the student to at least one classroom
- Link the student with parent/guardian details

After adding students, you can manage records, communication, and daily logs from each student profile.

## 3) Bulk Onboarding 🚀
