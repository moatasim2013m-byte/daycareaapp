# Step 5/7: Set Up Invoices, Tuition Plans, Discounts & Tax Rates

This guide documents how to configure Illumine billing end-to-end: fee components, discounts, taxes, manual invoices, recurring plans, student billing profiles, and invoice settings.

## 1) Set up essential billing components

Before creating invoices (manual or recurring), configure the following in **Fee Plan**.

### Fee Components
Use fee components for invoice line items such as tuition, activities, transport, or registration.

- Navigate to: **Fee Plan → Fee Components**
- Add:
  - Fee component name
  - Category
  - Unit price
  - Item code
  - Description (recommended)

### Discounts
Create discounts such as sibling discounts or early-payment offers.

- Navigate to: **Fee Plan → Discounts**
- Add:
  - Discount name
  - Discount amount/percentage
  - Item code
  - Discount type: **Standard** or **Conditional**
- Use **Conditional** discounts for time-limited or invoice-limited discount rules.

### Tax Rates
Configure tax slabs for compliance and transparent invoices.

- Navigate to: **Fee Plan → Tax Components**
- Add:
  - Tax name
  - Tax percentage
  - Item code

## 2) Choose billing method

You can bill either manually or with recurring tuition plans.

### A) Manual invoicing
Best for one-off or occasional charges (for example: field trips or registration fees).

- Navigate to: **Billing and Accounting → Invoices → Create Invoice**
- Steps:
  1. Select one or more students
  2. Set invoice date, due date, and billing period
  3. Add fee components (existing or new)
  4. Enter quantity for each fee component
  5. Apply discounts and taxes where required
  6. Click **Submit** to generate invoice

> Invoices are shared with parents on the configured invoice date.

### B) Recurring tuition plans
Best for monthly, quarterly, or term-based tuition billing.

- Navigate to: **Fee → Fee Plans → Create Fee Plan**
- Steps:
  1. Provide fee plan name
  2. Set billing frequency (for example: monthly, term-wise)
  3. Add fee components for each billing cycle/term

Recurring plans auto-generate invoices using the selected frequency.

## 3) Assign and manage student billing profiles

After templates are ready:

- Navigate to: **Billing and Accounting → Student Balances**
- You can:
  - Assign fee plans to students
  - View and manage credits/deposits
  - Add custom charges
  - Record advance payments

Click a student name to view full billing history (credits, deposits, invoices, and payment activity).

## 4) Manage invoices and collections

- Navigate to: **Billing and Accounting → Invoices**
- Use this area to:
  - Review all raised invoices
  - Track due dates and billed amounts
  - Record payments
  - Send reminders

## 5) Configure invoice and billing settings

- Navigate to: **Settings → Billing**
- Available controls include:
  - Currency code
  - Late fee configuration
  - Invoice number prefix
  - Online payment gateway settings
