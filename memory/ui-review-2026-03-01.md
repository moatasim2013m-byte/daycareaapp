# UI Review Notes (from provided screenshots)

Date: 2026-03-01

## Observations

1. **Activity naming is inconsistent across screens**:
   - Activity picker modal uses spaced names like `Gross Motor`.
   - Daily report table header shows `GrossMotor` (missing space).

2. **Activity taxonomy appears fragmented across modules**:
   - Activity picker shows a broad default catalog (e.g., Potty, Nap, Fine Motor, Stories).
   - Activity Settings includes custom activities (e.g., `smart artt`, `Sports`) and default items.
   - Daily Report only shows a subset of activities as columns.

3. **Communication area styling appears disconnected from activity flows**:
   - Messaging screen has distinct visual hierarchy and interaction patterns compared with Activity pages.

## Recommended product alignment

1. **Single source of truth for activity metadata**
   - Centralize activity definitions (name, icon, color, enabled state, report visibility).
   - Ensure every UI surface renders the same canonical display name.

2. **Consistency rules**
   - Enforce title formatting (e.g., `Gross Motor`, not `GrossMotor`).
   - Prevent duplicate labels that differ only by spacing/case.

3. **Configuration-to-runtime propagation**
   - Changes in Activity Settings should drive:
     - Post composer activity picker,
     - Daily report columns,
     - Any message templating/activity shortcuts.

4. **Validation and guardrails**
   - Add UI validation for new activity names (trim, collapse spaces, uniqueness check).
   - Add regression tests for name rendering and cross-screen activity visibility.

## Engineering follow-up checklist

- [ ] Define shared `ActivityDefinition` schema in backend + frontend contract.
- [ ] Add normalization utility for activity names.
- [ ] Add API endpoint/field to return activity ordering and report visibility.
- [ ] Update frontend components to consume shared activity metadata.
- [ ] Add tests for cross-screen consistency.
