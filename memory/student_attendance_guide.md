The **Student Attendance** section allows you to quickly record and track student check-ins, check-outs, and absences for each day. From one screen, you can view attendance status, mark entries in bulk, and filter students by room, group, or program.

This helps your center maintain accurate records and stay updated on daily attendance at all times.

## Access Student Attendance
1. From the left-hand menu, go to **Attendance & Leaves**.
2. Click **Student Attendance**.
3. You will land on the attendance dashboard for the selected date.

## Understand the Attendance Dashboard
At the top of the page, you can view a quick summary:
- **All Students**: Total students for the selected filters.
- **Pending**: Students whose attendance hasn’t been marked yet.
- **Check In**: Students currently checked in.
- **Check Out**: Students who have been checked out.
- **Absent**: Students marked absent.

This gives you a quick overview of attendance for the day.

## Filter Attendance View
Use the filters at the top to narrow down the list:
- **Date**: Select the day you want to record or view attendance.
- **Rooms**: Filter by classroom.
- **Groups**: Filter by group.
- **Programs**: Filter by program.

This is useful when managing attendance for specific classes.
