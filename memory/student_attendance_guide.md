# Student Attendance (Admin Guide)

## Overview
The **Student Attendance** module helps administrators and staff quickly record and monitor daily attendance statuses, including:
- Check-in
- Check-out
- Absent
- Pending (not yet marked)

From one screen, teams can filter students, take bulk actions, and switch between daily and monthly views.

## Access Student Attendance
1. From the left-hand menu, open **Attendance & Leaves**.
2. Select **Student Attendance**.
3. The system opens the attendance dashboard for the selected date.

## Understand the Attendance Dashboard
At the top of the page, dashboard counters provide a quick snapshot:
- **All Students**: Total students for the active filters.
- **Pending**: Attendance not marked yet.
- **Check In**: Students currently checked in.
- **Check Out**: Students already checked out.
- **Absent**: Students marked absent.

These counters give an immediate daily attendance overview.

## Filter Attendance View
Use top-level filters to narrow the student list:
- **Date**: Select the attendance day.
- **Rooms**: Filter by classroom.
- **Groups**: Filter by student group.
- **Programs**: Filter by program.

This is useful when handling attendance by class or program.

## Mark Student Attendance
Attendance can be marked directly in the student list.

### Check In a Student
1. Find the student.
2. Click **Check In** beside their name.
3. Check-in time is recorded automatically.

### Check Out a Student
1. Click **Check Out** beside the student's name.
2. Check-out time is saved.

### Mark a Student Absent
1. Select the student.
2. Click **Mark Absent**.

This keeps daily attendance records complete and accurate.

## Mark Attendance in Bulk
To update multiple students at once:
1. Select students using checkboxes.
2. Choose a bulk action:
   - **Check In**
   - **Check Out**
   - **Mark Absent**

Bulk actions reduce effort during busy arrival and departure times.

## Daily and Monthly View
The module supports two perspectives:
- **Daily view**: Mark attendance for a specific date.
- **Monthly view**: Review attendance trends and historical records.

## Search for a Student
Use the search bar to quickly locate a student and update attendance without scrolling through the full list.

## Why Accurate Attendance Matters
Reliable attendance tracking helps centers:
- Monitor student presence in real time.
- Maintain safety and compliance records.
- Share reliable updates with parents.
- Generate attendance reports.
- Identify absence trends.
